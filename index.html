During this project, I leveraged the systems of Unity and C# to develop coroutines present such as moving the camera, certain enemy attack sequences, and certain player weapons. 
To ensure me and my partner remained on task for our deadlines, we utilized Jira and its Sprints in order to ensure we delivered the project in time.
I also developed some of the ideas for our custom mechanic such as suggesting the idea of utilizing a weapon similar to Scorpion from MK.
